# Covid-19 Data Cleaning and Visualizations
#### Authors - Simran Kota and Suvechhya Pokhrel


## Our research Question:
How has COVID-19 spread since the first case was discovered? How has the trend changed since the introduction of key intervention measures such as social distancing, mask requirements, vaccinations, and more?

## Data Source
For this project we will be working with the Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset.  The data is compiled from a number of sources, including the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at John Hopkins University, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, various governmental sources, official reports, and more. 
A full description of the data sources included in this dataset can be found at the official [Github Repository](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/) for the dataset. 
While some variables are updated daily, others are updated weekly or periodically depending on the availability of data from the official sources.
